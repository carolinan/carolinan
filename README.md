### Hi there 👋

My name is Carolina Nymark and I am a long-term WordPress contributor,
with my main focus being the block editor, block themes, accessibility, and education.

I am a core committer, WordCamp speaker, former Themes Team representative, and bundled theme component maintainer.
I was one of the lead developers for the default themes Twenty Twenty-One and Twenty Twenty-Five.

For clarity: I am no longer sponsored or employed by Yoast and am currently looking for new sponsorship to support my open-source work.

I am open to remote work and interested in diversifying my work. I am especially interested in projects related to:
- Transitioning to blocks and block themes.
- Accessibility and disability rights.
- Custom block development (ACF or regular blocks).

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’” I am no longer sponsored to contribute to WordPress.

I have not opened GitHub sponsors again because I still need to figure out if and how
I would be able to return to contributing at least part time.
If you would like to sponsor me a few hours per month and be listed as a
sponsor of fullsiteediting.com (my FSE and block theme tutorial site), contact me.
  
- I am a core committer, WordCamp speaker and bundled theme component maintainer.
- I was one of the leads for the default themes Twenty Twenty-One and Twenty-Twenty-Five (And before you ask, yes once every four years is enough).
- With my limited avialability right now, I focus on contributing to Gutenberg, bundled themes, and the theme's support forums.
  
- ðŸ’» I work as a developer at Yoast.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about block themes and site editing.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: carolina@fullsiteediting.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She / Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a large collection of Eeyore items.
